# Metadata-fetch-queuing

Application that fetches metadata using serial queue. Implementation of a serial queue using OperationQueue. Runs only one concurrent operation. Refer to [overview](https://cocoapods.org)

## Cloning the project üö¥

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:apple/apple.git
```

## Features üöÄ
General overview for the project: 
- Employs MVVM architecture with functional reactive programming.
- Uses the combine framework for reactive binding.
- Uses diffable datsource for tableview population.
- Minimal use of external dependencies, used Kingfisher for image caching.
- Avoided the use of IBDesignable and IBInspectable inorder to make storyboards a bit light.
- Unit tested only a small portion of the application.
- Made sure that there are no constraint breaks and memory leaks

## Areas for improvement
Some notable areas for fixing: 
- Unit testing can be implemented throughout the application with a very significant code coverage.
- Metadata caching can be done, so we do not have to always make api calls
