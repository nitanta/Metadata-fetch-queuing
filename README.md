# Metadata-fetch-queuing

Application that fetches metadata using serial queue. Implementation of a serial queue using OperationQueue. Runs only one concurrent operation. Refer to [overview](cocoapodsURL)

## Cloning the project üö¥

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:apple/apple.git
```

## Features üöÄ
General overview for the project:
    - Employs MVVM architecture with functional reactive programming.
    - Uses the combine framework for reactive binding.
    - Uses diffable datsource for tableview population.
    - Minimal use of external dependencies, used Kingfisher for image caching.
    - Avoided the use of IBDesignable and IBInspectable inorder to make storyboards a bit light.
    - Unit tested only a small portion of the application.
    - Made sure that there are no constraint breaks and memory leaks

## Areas for improvement
Some notable areas for fixing:
    - Unit testing can be implemented throughout the application with a very significant code coverage.
    - Metadata caching can be done, so we do not have to always make api calls
